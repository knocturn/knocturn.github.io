		<p>Knockturn was founded in San Francisco, California in May of 2013 by Venk Saleem and Hashim Jacobs. The two young gentlemen became acquainted 
		through the WAKA Dodgeball League of San Francisco in June of 2012. Realizing that many people in the city liked organizing parties together sharing
		the expenses in the end, Hashim and Venk came up with an easier way for people to organize get-togethers whether they're in front of their computers
		or on the move. Presto! KnocTurn, Inc. was born.</p>
		<p>The newly-found start-up grew in popularity rapidly. Little marketing or advertising was needed, for the application itself was so simple, yet 
		intriguing enough for just a few individuals to want to share</p>
